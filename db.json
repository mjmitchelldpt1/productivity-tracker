I was running into difficulty with it pushing the data as undefined because it hadn't finished fetching the data.  I'm still processing and working through this.  There are other features of useQuery I need to learn to make this a smooth transition and also to drill down error and loading handlers.",

There was issues with axios, and I wasn't quite able to understand how to send my data points to my entriesAPI and back to my state.  This is probably a major flaw in my state management that is preventing me from writing accordingly.",
